# Optimising Inventory Management with Mixed Integer Linear Programming
This project focuses on optimising inventory management for **perishable goods** using a **Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)** approach. The case study involves **Gigi Coffee**, a food and beverage company operating a central warehouse and multiple retail outlets in Malaysia.

The model incorporates:
- Supplier lead times  
- Minimum order quantities  
- Ingredient shelf life  
- Holding and wastage costs  
- Safety stock levels  
- Sales forecast data

The objective is to minimise total inventory costs while ensuring all demand is fulfilled and stockouts are avoided. The Key concepts are as follows:-
- Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)
- Inventory optimisation for perishable goods
- Data cleaning & preprocessing (BOM, inventory balance, sales)
- Comparison with traditional (r, Q) and (s, S) inventory policies
- Cost evaluation: purchasing, holding, and wastage
- Implementation using Python & PuLP solver
- A inventory management demo was implemented using Gradio package in python
